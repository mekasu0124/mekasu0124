## Introduction

This repository is a collection of projects developed by Mek (me) or Mek & Friends, showcasing my, or our, skills in various languages and frameworks. Feel free to explore and contribute to any open-source projects. Anyone is welcome to [join our community](https://discord.gg/vU7BHVtHdR). Ages 13+ Please.

## Desktop Apps

Mek builds desktop applications using C# with Avalonia & CommunityToolkit.MVVM or ElectronJS with ReactJS. Although I prefer to build my desktop applications as web apps, I am working on separating out C# with Avalonia & CommunityToolkit.MVVM from ElectronJS with ReactJS and leaving the desktop applications to just C#.

## Mobile Apps

Mobile apps are built using [React Native JS](https://reactnative.dev/). At this time, I have not been able to dive far into this framework as I have primarily focused on learning website and web-app frameworks along with desktop frameworks as that is where my initial interest aligned. I do plan within the coming year or two to dive into the React Native framework and learn how it works to build mobile application counterparts to my web-apps, etc.

## Web Apps and Website

I currently use [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) to build the client-side aspect of websites which classifies them as web-apps, however, I classify them as websites when they're not an "online software" that the user can use for various purposes. Websites are for showcasing information about a company, talent, art, or other and allowing user's a way to view and interact with it. For example: (In my opinion) Facebook is a web app, however, your local middle school has a website. Both are valid, however, I use ReactJS and NextJS to build the client-sides for both.

## About Mek

I am a passionate programmer currently obtaining a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science focusing on Software Development and Cyber Security at the [University of Phoenix Online](https://www.phoenix.edu/). I enjoy building desktop apps using C# & Avalonia or ElectronJS wrapped around ReactJS.
