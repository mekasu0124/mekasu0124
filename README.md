## Introduction

Hello there, and welcome to my repo! In this repo, you will find the various applications currently in development or ready for your enjoyment. I may even list ideas that I may have for applications to build. I have been programming for nearly a decade now with majority of my experience being in Python. I fell in love with Python for its ease of use and readability; not to mention the fact it's super easy to learn for beginners! In my years, I have indulged myself in two other languages, C# and JavaScript. Although C# is fun at times and Python will always be my mother language, JavaScript with the capabilities of building applications in both web-app and desktop environments is just where it's at lol!

I digress. At this point in life I am in college, full-time, for my Bachelor's in Computer Science focusing in Software Development and Cyber Security. I'm not much of a game dev, but sitting down and re-creating applications that are on my computer just to see if I can do it is where I have the most fun. Side note, I also enjoy building discord bots in Python and/or JavaScript as well. Below you will find the layout of what applications I am currently building, which ones are public release, and what the applications are built using as far as the client-side framework is concerned.

I do love a good framework that does a lot of the heavy lifting for me, however, I do still create static websites from time to time. What I mean by a *"static website"* is a website that is built using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. Static websites, in my opinion, are great for websites that just showcase information and do not handle things such as user accounts, debit/credit card transactions, etc. Wikipedia would be a good example of a static website if I would have built it.
