## Introduction

Welcome aboard to Mek's Hub. This hub has been built for the purpose of having a collective environment for all the projects that I have developed and released to the public. All projects are open-source and some come with installers and updaters. I don't mind if anyone forks/clones the repo, just please do not claim the work as your own and do not push your changes to the main repo. I typically use a GNLPv3 or Apache2 License when developing my apps. Please follow this license.

> **Note:** At this time, only C# projects come with updaters/installers. All Python projects are source-compiled. All JavaScript projects that are websites are self-hosted; All others can be found on the app store for download.

> **Note:** Any projects that are used and pushed to the repository with files that are missing and preventing you from running said application will have comments throughout the code explaining what file is needed and why. If you see that a file is missing and there is no explanation for it, please create a help channel in the [discord server]("https://discord.gg/vU7BHVtHdR").

## Other Notes

- Future Updates:
    - repo restructure:
        - find a better way to outline applications and have the applications denoted by language and/or frameworks used with those apps.

## A Little About Me

Hi! My name is Mek and I have been programming as a hobbyist for roughly eight years. I am currently in school for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science focusing in Software Development and Cyber Security. My programming passions are currently to just learn as much as I can, when I can, as I work a full-time job. However, in my spare time I enjoy building desktop apps using C# & Avalonia or ElectronJS wrapped around ReactJS as if I were building a website.

I have been programming on and off since ~2017 after my best friend introduced me to an a.i. model he was working on. It was fascinating. It was this little red car on the screen that was learning its way around the racetrack. It was running into the walls and such. It was hilarous. This memory is how I got introduced to [Python](https://python.org). Although I was a rather stubborn beginner. I took all of a day (or a few hours?) to learn a bit about the basics and then I jumped straight into trying to build a discord bot using the disnake api. Which was a lot more than I expected to be given that my best friend made it all just look so easy :P. 

To outline my hobbies in a more respectible manner, I enjoy building websites and desktop apps. I found my niche in them, I just have not learned the Cyber Security parts of it yet. That comes later in my degree plan in school. I am a full-time student at the [University of Phoenix](https://www.phoenix.edu/) where I take online classes at a more relaxed pace to help the flow with my work schedule.
