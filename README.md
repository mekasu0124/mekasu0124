## Introduction

Welcome aboard to Mek's Hub. This hub has been built for the purpose of having a collective environment for all the projects that I have developed and release to the public. All projects are open-source and some come with installers and updaters. I don't mind if anyone forks or clones the repo, just please do not claim the work as your own and do not push your changes to the main repo. 

**Note:** At this time, only C# projects come with updaters/installers. All Python projects are source-compiled. All JavaScript projects that are websites are source-compiled and self-hosted; All others can be found on the app store for download.

## Other Notes

I do work a full time job and I am the only developer/maintainer of these applications. I am at my computer every night, however, most nights are spent doing school work. I will check your comments/issues/fork pushes as often as I can. Please be patient with me.
